>>>Phylogenetic analyis
  There are three different parts of the analysis
  1. PAML
    Branch specific DN/DS analysis
    1. Check SDA for chimp
    2. Gather sequence for chimp, hg38, bonobo, gorilla and orang
    3. run CDS alignment
        MAFFT (module on cluster)
    4. run protein alignment
    5. Codon alighment
        /net/eichler/vol26/projects/primate_sv/nobackups/Tools/TREEasy/translatorx_vLocal.pl
    6. run PAML
  2. Build Phylo tree
    IQTree
        1. Run MSA with MAFFT
        2. run it from Yafei's home dir
  3. Melecular clock
    BEAST MODE

>>>existing sample qc
  HPRC has its own pc stats
  sample names: 
    cat /net/eichler/vol26/projects/chm13_t2t/nobackups/assemblies_for_anlysis/sample_info{GIAB,UW_HPRC_HiFi,WUSTL_HPRC_HiFi,WUSTL_OTHER_HiFi}
  stats are in this dir /net/eichler/vol27/projects/hprc/nobackups/assemblies/hifiasm_trio_yr1


>>>hifiasm
  takes three inputs:
    1. all the hifi reads
    2. illumina kmer from mom
    3. illumina kmer from dad
  uses all the hifi reads to genreate an assembly graph and use the uniq kmers from mom and dad to phase
